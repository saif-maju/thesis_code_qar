{"context": "This does all I required. It is not very heavy and has key and combination locks so it is versatile. Overall, not too expensive, not too heavy and keeps prying fingers from your valuables. This is a great affordable safe! This safe has plenty of room to fit all of my valuables including my prescriptions. It also has the extra security of including a key along with the access keycode. The only setup is installing batteries and choosing a combination! I strongly recommend this safe if you are tight for space but need a secure, affordable safe! You can also use a letter A or B. But to actually open the safe you have to input the correct password and have the key to actually open the door. Pay attention here. The safe comes with one Master key that will bypass the keypad. You use that when the batteries run out or you lose the password. But for daily use you use the other key. This key has a large black grip. This key is used in combination with the keypad. This black key will not open the safe without the right combo. The steel is soft and can easily be bent outward using a heavy screwdriver.) To be reasonably secure, the safe should be bolted to a wall or to a very sturdy shelf. The lock was simple to program and batteries were included. It is a 'fair' choice as a lock up for a home defense pistol. While it is fast and easy to get into, provided you do not squirrel the key somewhere, the lock 'beep' is VERY loud. So, you better get the combination right the first time in a tactical situation, or the home invader is going to know where you are and what you are trying to do. I caught a neighbor red-handed when I had my back turned towards my computer and turned around. She had a prescription bottle in her hand and was looking at the label. I've been taken advantage of several times in the past and decided it was time to take action.I had a bit of difficulty programming the combination because I kept holding down the setup button rather than releasing it before keying in the new combination. It was frustrating and I was about to call their support line when I figured it out. Other than that I'm happy with the safe. Unfortunately, I must have received a defective product. After inserting the key, entering the manufacturer's combination and successfully opening the safe I was able to recode the combination to my own number with no trouble at all. Then when I tried to close the safe and test the new combination, the key would not turn all the way to the locked position. I also could not remove the key in any position...it was stuck in the keyhole. After many attempts at trying to persuade the key to turn and fully lock, with the door both open and closed, I gave up and am returning this product. This safe is great and has been used daily over the past year. The safe has been working great, and i've only had to have one battery change. This safe comes with a spare key, and 2 dials for opening the safe. The key code, is well built, and the safe itself has been highly durable. It has a good amount of room for what you need to store and also has a built in light for when your in the dark looking for something. I look forward to many more years of use out of the safe and highly recommend it to everyone looking for a place to securely place their valuables. i like this product , but i lost the key , i would like to know if i can get a copy .. i was trying to find out where i can call , but i couldnt get a costumer service number where i can call .. if someone can help me with this issue i will be very happy... otherwise the product is good ... You can bolt it to a shelf or floor to keep someone from walking off with it. Overall it should do what I want it to. Will try to repair. Cannot recommend at this time.
